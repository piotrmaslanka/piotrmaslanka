## Hi there

Born in 1991, I know over 23 languages on 10 hardware platforms, including [COBOL](https://gist.github.com/piotrmaslanka/5321826) and PL/I (I had an extra 192 hours course in IBM mainframe tech), I can program both x86-64 and [Atmel AVR](https://github.com/piotrmaslanka/alarm-avr). I can even design a CPU, if asked to do so nicely.

I've started programming in primary school, wrote my first [OS kernel](https://github.com/piotrmaslanka/miaos) (*in assembly*) in middle school.

I've finished Technical School as an IT technician (with honors), then I finished MEng in CS (with honors as well), and biotechnology (BEng, I've figured out how to treat [diabetes in hedgehogs](https://henrietta.com.pl/index.php/2021/07/25/biomolekularne-przeslanki-stosowania-insuliny-wieprzowej-w-terapii-cukrzycy-u-jeza-europejskiego/)). I've also completed 4 years of doctoral school, but dropped out at 4th year.
I've finished 1st year of Emergency Medical Services with the highest grade, then I dropped these studies, since I'm already a qualified first aider.

I'm an expert witness. Oh, and I invented [SMOK](https://github.com/smok-serwis) in 2009, back then, I wrote everything - from firmware (C/Tibbo Basic), to backend (Python 2), to frontend (jQuery). Now it's a real company.

Besides I'm interested in medicine, law (having read GDPR and [EMC law](2014/30/UE)).
I'm also the author of the majority of the software in [SMOK's repository](https://github.com/smok-serwis), so my company delivers more FOSS than two largest IT companies in Rzesz√≥w, Poland, where I live.
