## Hi there

Born in 1991, I know over 23 languages on 10 hardware platforms, including COBOL and PL/I (I had an extra 192 hours course in IBM mainframe tech), I can program both x86-64 and Atmel AVR.

I've started programming in primary school, wrote my first [OS kernel](https://github.com/piotrmaslanka/miaos) (*in assembly*) in middle school.

I've finished Technical School as an IT technician (with honors), then I finished MEng in CS (with honors as well), and biotechnology.
I've finished 1st year of Emergency Medical Services with the highest grade, then I dropped these studies, since I'm already a qualified first aider.

I'm an expert witness.

Oh, and I invented [SMOK](https://github.com/smok-serwis) in 2009.

Besides I'm interested in medicine, law (having read GDPR and [EMC law](2014/30/UE).
